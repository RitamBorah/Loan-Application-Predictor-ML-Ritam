# Loan-Application-Predictor-ML-Ritam

Analyzed the Loan data and applied different ML models to detect defaulters and predict load eligibility
Performed an EDA on data to understand customer behavior and found the most effective features
Applied and tested various techniques like the imputation of missing values, preprocessing of data, outliers
detectors feature engineering, and dimensionality reduction for improving the accuracy of the model
Implemented machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random forest
Model predicted accuracy of 75% for detecting loan defaulters and automating the loan eligibility process
